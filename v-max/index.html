						<h2>What is V-MAX</h2>
						<p>
							V-MAX is a global leader delivering digital performance solutions
							for today’s cloud-mobile world. When our clients needed to update
							their brand to match their innovative products and solutions, they
							came to Splice Media to revamp their digital portals and evolve
							their website.
						</p>
						<p>
							We’ve all been there: The project is running behind, or over
							budget, or maybe things are going a bit off track. Tensions are
							high. Fingers are pointing. And the C-suite is asking, “How did
							this happen? It was all in the brief!”
						</p>
						<p>
							Well, maybe that’s the problem. The first step in any digital
							marketing project is usually putting together a creative brief –
							it’s how project teams and client stakeholders make sure everyone
							is - literally - on the same page. And in theory, it’s how the
							project stays on time, on track, and on budget. In reality, it
							doesn’t always work that way.
						</p>
						<h2>Digital marketing project management challenges</h2>
						<p>
							What starts out as excitement and enthusiasm for a new marketing
							project can quickly devolve into the chaos of fire drills. Whether
							they’re the result of misunderstandings about requirements, having
							aligned everyone around unrealistic goals, encountering technical
							difficulties, or trying to respond to conflicting direction or
							feedback, fire drills become the source of team frustration,
							schedule misses, and budget overruns. Everyone hates them, and no
							one knows how to get things back on track. It’s demoralizing for
							you and your agency partners.

						<h2>How a Velocity Workshop works</h2>
						<p>
							It’s pretty simple. We get everyone involved in the project into a
							room together. On the client side, this can include the CMO,
							director or VP of marketing, and any other relevant stakeholder.
							On the agency side, we bring the project manager, lead UX, lead
							developers, lead designer, and content team that will actually be
							working on the project. And then we start talking. We hammer out
							the details. And we visualize all the project components using
							every inch of our whiteboards and wall space, breaking down the
							elements so we can organize them easily.
						</p>
						<p>
							Doing this in-person and getting the entire team involved really
							opens up the conversation and helps with understanding. Plus, we
							get to know each other, which always makes things run more
							smoothly.
						</p>

						<p>
							When the project team and the client are in 100% alignment on what
							we know and what we don’t know, we roadmap it. This is where we
							bust out the colored cards, break the project down into essential
							elements, and put them together to create a clear, viable project
							roadmap from start to completion. Hours and estimates are adjusted
							or confirmed in complete transparency for budget validation—which
							means no more uncomfortable conversations about change orders or
							timelines when you’re in the thick of things.

						<h2>Why V-MAX</h2>
						<p>
							One of the reasons B2B marketing projects go off track is that
							proposals and estimates are typically created by the people whose
							job it is to bring in business—agency owners, business-development
							teams, or sales folks. These roles tend to be focused on the
							numbers and are more risk and ambiguity tolerant. The people
							executing the project, on the other hand, need certainty, and tend
							to avoid risk. These are the designers, content strategists,
							project managers, and programmers. When these two groups don’t see
							eye to eye, everyone can be in for a rocky ride.
						</p>
						<p>
							To avoid these kinds of project challenges, you have to close the
							gap between estimation and execution. By aligning everyone from
							the outset on the same goals, expectations, and realities, you can
							better set your project up for success.
						</p>
						<h2>Introducing Splice V-MAX Workshop</h2>
						<p>
							At Splice Media, we’ve created a unique discovery process that
							does just that. At the beginning of each project, we hold a V-MAX
							Workshop, which is like a live-action brief. By nature, a workshop
							is much more effective than a written brief, because let’s be
							honest—how do you know if everyone is really reading the brief? Do
							they understand it? And how much information are they retaining?
							By holding a V-MAX Workshop at the beginning of a project, we can
							make sure everyone is actually on the same page, and that the
							estimation is realistic on every level. It’s a smarter, faster way
							to get everyone aligned on both the approach and the requirements.

						<h2>Better process, better results</h2>
						<p>
							When everyone has a better understanding of the “why,” they also
							have a better understanding of the “what.” By kicking off projects
							with a V-MAX Workshop, we close the gap between estimation and
							execution, empowering both our team and client stakeholders with a
							roadmap to success. Projects move faster and are less likely to
							run over budget or miss the scheduled launch. And all those fire
							drills, those become a thing of the past. Plus, hashing out the
							details face-to-face creates a personal dynamic that builds
							relationships, increases information intake, and reduces
							miscommunication. It all adds up to a better experience, and
							better outcomes, for everyone.
						</p>

						<h2>V-MAX: A real world definition?</h2>
						<p>
							In enzyme kinetics, Vmax is the maximum velocity or rate at which
							the enzyme catalyzed a reaction. It happens when all enzyme active
							sites are saturated with substrate. Since the maximum velocity is
							described to be directly proportional to enzyme concentration, it
							can therefore be used to estimate enzyme concentration.
						</p>
						<p>
							VMAX: Maximum speed Definition VMAX is the maximum speed defining
							the aircraft's flight envelope. VMAX is equal to: - VMO/MMO in
							clean configuration with landing gears up. ... It is the
							recommended speed to select CONF 2. It is displayed as a green
							''S'' on the PFD airspeed scale
